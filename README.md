# Solar Power Generation Forecasting

## Overview
This project aims to predict solar power generation using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data on solar power output and weather conditions, we develop models that can forecast the power output based on the given weather forecasts.

## Files Description
- `solar.csv`: Contains historical data on solar power generation.
- `weather.csv`: Includes weather data that correlates with solar power generation.
- `merged.csv`: A combined dataset of solar power and weather data, prepared for analysis.
- `forecast_predictions.csv`: Output file containing predictions from the model.
- `random_forest_model.pkl`: A trained Random Forest model saved in pickle format.
- `file2.ipynb`, `file3.ipynb`, `file4.ipynb`: Jupyter notebooks containing the analysis, model training, and prediction processes.
